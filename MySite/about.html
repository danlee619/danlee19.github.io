    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bring with me a diverse skillset, having studied within many areas of the IT profession. I am a Cisco Networking Academy graduate and have passed the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) Comprehensive Exam. Thusly I have ample knowledge of how to create, maintain, and troubleshoot Local Area Networks (LANs) and the associated network devices. While working full time I have continued my studies and have acquired skills in programming (Java, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL) and in web design (HTML5/CSS3). I am also familiar with Microsoft and Adobe applications like Excel, Access, Powerpoint, Dreamweaver, and Photoshop.
	<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I received my bachelor’s degree from the University of California Santa Barbara in Film and Media with an emphasis in Media Analysis. I possess extensive skills in written and verbal communications, with a particularly pronounced skills in critical analysis and analytical reasoning. This was particularly useful in teaching me how to deconstruct complex problems in order to achieve concrete approaches to finding a solution. 
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was able to further hone my interpersonal skills working as a Marketing and Promotions Assistant for the Los Angeles based comedy production company Comedy Juice. In addition to requiring me to increase my familiarity with social media and online marketing, it required me to interact with a wide variety of personalities. The world of standup comedy is particularly mercurial and I by extension had to be equally flexible. From the comedians, to the business owners, to the guests at the shows, in my dealings I always had to be witty, informed, pleasant, and above all calm under pressure. 
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I currently am a Group Lead for The Party Staff which has only furthered my experience working in high-pressure environments. As Group Lead I am the lead cook and am responsible for overseeing all the other Party Staff cooks to ensure work gets done. I act as a liaison between the home office and the client. Working in a world of hard deadlines where time is limited and additional help is frequently nonexistent has imbued me with grace under pressure and the capacity to achieve goal under difficult circumstances. 
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a highly motivated, and quick learner. I constantly seek to improve myself professionally. If there are any areas where i lack experience I more than compensate for it with determination to achieve. I have made a habit of exceeding expectations and am eager to rise to the unique challenges presented by this position. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
