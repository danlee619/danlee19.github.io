    <br>Armed with a passion for networking configurations and a liberal arts degree, I love to learn new technologies and tackle unfamiliar problems. As a Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) I am qualified to create, maintain, and troubleshoot Local Area Networks and the associated network devices. I’m looking for a team to join where I can learn and be rewarded for my curiousity.
	<br><br>IFor the past three years, in addition to working full time, I have pursued my passion for all things IT by taking 49 units at colleges in programming languages like Java, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL and web design (HTML5/CSS3). I am also familiar with Microsoft and Adobe applications like Excel, Access, Powerpoint, Dreamweaver, and Photoshop. 
<br><br>I received my bachelor’s degree from the University of California Santa Barbara in Film and Media with an emphasis in Media Analysis. As a skilled verbal and written communicator, I have managed a team for The Party Staff and acted as a liaison between the company and clients. Working in a world of hard deadlines where time is limited and additional help is frequently nonexistent has imbued me with grace under pressure and the capacity to achieve my goals under difficult circumstances.
<br><br>I was able to further hone my interpersonal skills working as a Marketing and Promotions Assistant for the Los Angeles based comedy production company Comedy Juice. In addition to requiring me to increase my familiarity with social media and online marketing, it required me to interact with a wide variety of personalities. The world of standup comedy is particularly mercurial and I by extension had to be equally flexible. From the comedians, to the business owners, to the guests at the shows, in my dealings I always had to be witty, informed, pleasant, and above all calm under pressure.
<br><br>I am a highly motivated, and quick learner. I constantly seek to improve myself professionally. If there are any areas where I lack experience I more than compensate for them with my  determination to achieve. I have made a habit of exceeding expectations and am eager to rise to the unique challenges presented by a networking career.
